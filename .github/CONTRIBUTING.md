# Contribution guidelines

* Bug reports are welcome.
* Feature requests are not accepted.
* Pull requests are accepted, however the scope of this project is intended to remain
   small to keep the maintenance burden low. If you intend to add something not trivial,
   please open an issue first to check if it fits the scope. Forking this project and
   using it as a base to build something larger or different is otherwise preferred.
